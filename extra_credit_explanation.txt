For my extra credit, I made visualize_america.py. This program uses a map of the US and displays the 50 most populus cities in the country. I also needed to make cities_population_extra_credit.txt, which is the same as cities_population.txt except that it has a complete list of city information (country, region, etc) rather than a truncated list (I needed this so I would know which cities are american). I used sort_cities_extra_credit.py to make this text file.
